# Who?

- For sure, me.
- As a developer
- As a geek; Game, Soccer, Photo, Clothes, Music
- Should I choose one? Think it later

---
# When?

- Start : end of designing
- due? as fast as possible with minimal feature #keep_in_lean_and_agile

---
# Where?

- On website for PC, mobile
- email subscription

---
# What?

- Share my daily challenge and  get feedback from readers
- Blog post seems a best option, but in my experience, writing  a blog post was not easy.
- I need a way to share my thinking effectively.
- Making blog post as a result of a challenge.
- Need a habit for that

---
# How?

- I struggled to answer this question, because using a markdown blog solution is enough to meet the requirements.
- But I want to make my own website for practicing my web dev skills and more extensible features.
- So, "Why" question should be placed first


---
# Why?

- To present myself
- To make web dev as a habit
- To improve web dev skills
- To get web design skills

---
# How? again

- Make a simple markdown enabled blog
